# Hand Gesture Detection
Python, MediaPipe, OpenCV, Scikit-Learn
Developed a system to recognize hand gestures for sign
languageusing real-time video input. Utilized MediaPipe for accurate
handlandmark detection and Scikit-Learn to train classification
modelsbased on extracted features. Enabled efficient and
reliableinterpretation of static hand signs for improved accessibility.
